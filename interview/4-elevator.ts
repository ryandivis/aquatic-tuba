/**
# Elevator System Challenge

## Objective

Create a program that simulates an elevator system. The system should take ride requests and transport users as efficiently as possible.

## Basic Requirements

1. **Single Elevator System**:
   - Implement a single elevator that processes ride requests and moves to the correct floors.
   - Optimize to minimize user wait times.

2. **Multiple Elevators**:
   - Extend the program to support multiple elevators.
   - Assign ride requests to the most appropriate elevator.

## Bonus Features (Optional)

- **Time of Day Optimizations**: Implement different behaviors based on morning and afternoon usage patterns.
- **Empty Trips**: Consider whether taking empty trips helps the system run more efficiently overall.
- **Speed vs. Usage**: Implement different strategies for optimizing elevator movement (speed vs. usage balance).

## Example Input/Output

Input: A request for a ride from floor 2 to floor 10.
Output: Elevator 1 is moving from floor 1 to floor 2. Elevator 1 is transporting user to floor 10.

## Constraints

- The elevator can only move one floor at a time.
- Multiple requests can be added, and the system should handle them efficiently.

## Good Luck!
